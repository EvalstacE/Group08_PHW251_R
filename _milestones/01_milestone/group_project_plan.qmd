# Roles and Responsibilities

## Meeting Planning: 

### Communication method: 

What is your team's preferred communication method - email, text, bcourse messaging?

### Meeting times and frequency: 

When will your team be holding meetings? How frequently will you meet? 
Are there times or days that work well for everyone?

Discuss future non-academic commitments that might affect members' availability.

Discuss meeting tempo: “checking in” at the beginning of meetings versus “just sticking to business”.


------------------------------------------------

### Method for tracking progress: 

How is your team going to keep track of progress? 
Who will be taking minutes, creating agendas, and contacting the course facilitators with questions?

#### Point person: 

We encourage you to discuss potential dates and times to meet with a course facilitator during Weeks 3-5. Decide on the best date and time for all.

## Conflict Management

If a conflict arises, plan to solve the issue as soon as possible. 

This is best done using synchronous (Zoom, Google Hangouts) communication rather than asynchronous (email).

If the group is unable to resolve the conflict, seek advice from the instructional team.
