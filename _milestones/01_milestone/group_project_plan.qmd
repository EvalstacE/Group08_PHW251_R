### Method for tracking progress: 

How is your team going to keep track of progress? 

Who will be taking minutes, creating agendas, and contacting the course facilitators with questions?

## Conflict Management


If a conflict arises, plan to solve the issue as soon as possible. 

This is best done using synchronous (Zoom, Google Hangouts) communication rather than asynchronous (email).

If the group is unable to resolve the conflict, seek advice from the instructional team.
