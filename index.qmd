# Project Description {.unnumbered}

You have been given three datasets: dataset one contains weekly data about a novel infectious respiratory disease outbreak containing the number of cases and case severity by demographic categories (age category, race, sex) and geographic categories (county) for California counties (except for Los Angeles county); dataset two contains morbidity and population data by similar demographic and geographic categories for Los Angeles county, and dataset three populations estimates for 2023 by county and demographic categories. 

**Our role:**

You are an employee of the California Department of Public Health working on infectious disease surveillance.

**Research question:**

Your supervisors are interested to know the course of the outbreak, if it is disproportionately affecting certain demographic or geographic populations and how prevention and treatment resources should be allocated.

**Data:**

You have been given three datasets: 

  * **Dataset one (sim_novelid_CA.csv)** contains weekly data about cases and case severity by demographic categories (age category, race, sex) and geographic categories (county) for California counties (except for Los Angeles county); 
  
  * **Dataset two (sim_novelid_LACounty.csv)** contains population data by similar demographic and geographic categories for Los Angeles county.
  
  * **Dataset three (ca_pop_2023.csv)** population estimates data by demographic category and county for 2023.  
  
  
**Data Merging, Summarization, and Reporting:**

For milestones 4-6, you will join these datasets together to create a single dataset with aggregated summary morbidity and/or severity metrics and calculate rates. This dataset should be used to generate print-worthy visualizations (at least one table and one graph) to be included in the final report.
